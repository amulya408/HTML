<td>Sweet corn</td>
<td>Most of the famous food of Vizag is available at beaches. This boiled sweet corn carts can be found all along the belt of Tenneti Park and RK beach.

There is nothing special with the corn or the taste of it here; but eating it while taking a walk in the seashore is totally worth it. You can also get roasted corn, cooked directly on burning coals.</td>
